*backuppc-3.1.0 (29 Sep 2009)

16 Nov 2009; Lenno Nagel <lenno@nagel.ee> +backuppc-3.1.0-r2.ebuild:
	Added a new patch for fixing the pidfile dir (/var/log -> /var/run)

29 Sep 2009; Lenno Nagel <lenno@nagel.ee> +backuppc-3.1.0.ebuild:
	Wrote a new ebuild for 3.1.0 based on the old versions.
	I really hope this is much cleaner and more reliable than the
	other ebuilds that have been floating around for BackupPC.
	Hopefully this will make it to the main portage tree one day :)
